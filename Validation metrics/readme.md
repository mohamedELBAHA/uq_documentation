<h2 align='center'> Comparison Methods of Uncertainty Estimation Approaches </h2> 

## Introduction
To compare the different approaches of uncertainty quantification presented in this project, we will use several metrics used in the state of the art  of UQ, namely :

1. Negative Log-Likelihood 
2. Excpected Calibration Error
3. Calibration Curve
4. Sharpness
5. Coverage


You can find in the python file implementations of the above mentioned metrics. 
we also note that in this project we used a python library  [uncertainty Toolbox](https://uncertainty-toolbox.github.io/) that gathers several metrics.
